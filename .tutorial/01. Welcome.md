## How To Add a Favicon in HTML 


"**A favicon**  is a small image displayed next to the page title in the browser tab.



**Tip: A favicon is a small image, so it should be a simple image with high contrast.**
You can use any image you like as your favicon. You can also create your own favicon on sites like https://www.favicon.cc.


**A favicon image is displayed to the left of the page title in the browser tab, like this:**

![favicon sample](sample.png)

**Example of favicon**
To add a favicon to your website, either save your favicon image to the root directory of your webserver, or create a folder in the root directory called images, and save your favicon image in this folder. A common name for a favicon image is "favicon.ico".

Next, add a <link> element to your "index.html" file, after the <title> element, like this:

![Example](Code.png)
Now, save the "index.html" file and reload it in your browser. Your browser tab should now display your favicon image to the left of the page title.
